The Minicruises are a wonderful experience, impressive, unforgettable that we recommend to all those who visit Sicily. We recommend to book/buy the tickets to do the minicruises well in advance of the desired date.
Departing from Ports of Vulcano and Lipari, our Travel Agency have typical aeolian boats of various capacities (50, 80, 120 and 160 seats).
The boats are equipped with all comforts with highly qualified crew. This type of boat allows you to get into small coves, navigate closer to the coastal areas of the islands and gives the opportunity to admire the sculptures impressed in the rocks by atmospheric events through the centuries."
